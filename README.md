# Brewdad Automation
Everything related to this man's automated home brewery

The brewery consists of a control panel with a Raspberry Pi 3B at the heart of it,
with a number of sensors, valves, heating coils, motors, and pumps connected to it.
Some of the sensors are homemade, so this repo contains code running on the Pi 3B,
as well as code for any of the related devices.

This repo is primarily here for me to keep a code backup and track changes, but anyone can
reuse the code here for their own purposes. The "code" is primarily Node-RED flows.
